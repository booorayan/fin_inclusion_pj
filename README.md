# A Simple ML Model that Predicts Whether an Individual from East Africa Owns a Bank Account

#### The project involves the creation of a simple machine learning model that predicts whether individuals situated in East Africa own a bank or not. Owning a bank account is an indicator of access to financial services and financial inclusion. Therefore, one can use the model to predict the state of financial inclusion in the regions covered in the dataset. 

#### The dataset used for this project was obtained from here http://bit.ly/FinancialDataset and it includes data from 2016 - 2018.

## Description
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model that predicts if an individual owns a bank account or not. This information (i.e. on possession of bank account) can in turn be used to predict the state of financial inclusion in a given region (East Africa). The dataset used contains information on four East African countries, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda. The first step was to conduct data cleaning, e.g. dropping missing/null values from the dataset because they accounted for less than 5% of the data (missing values were only 1.1% of the total observations).
Bivariate and univariate analysis were conducted on the data to help determine appropriate features. Prinicpal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction and the Random Forests Classifier was used to create the model. 

## Requirements
The libraries required for this project included:

      pandas - for performing data analysis and cleaning.

      numpy - used for fast matrix operations.

      Matplotlib - used to create plots.

      seaborn - used for creating plots.
  
The language used was python3 and the classifier chosen for the project was the random forest classifier.
